      # This command runs tests directly inside a temporary container
      # It leverages the scripts/test_local.sh logic for a more robust approach
      # For a simpler approach, you could just mount the volume and run npm test
      # However, since test_local.sh already handles cleanup and execution inside Docker
      # it's better to use it.
      run: ./scripts/test_local.sh
